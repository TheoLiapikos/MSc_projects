							<h2>Few words about the project</h2>
						</header>
						<p>This project have been developed by two students studying at M.Sc in Data and Web Science of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. The task was to extract the sentiment that our twitters had.  </p>
						<p align="justify">The field of emotional analysis has been particularly concerned within the scientific and business sectors over the last decade. It is also known as opinion mining and it is particularly important as it helps businesses understand their audience opinion about them. This research covers a relatively small range of literature on the subject, and presents some state-of-the-art technologies and innovations that have been developed. Mechanical learning techniques as well as natural language processing techniques will be analyzed, which when combined will produce good results. In the final section, some unsolved issues will be discussed. </p>
